# info about project
  python-geoip
python-geoip is a library that provides access to GeoIP databases. Currently it only supports accessing MaxMind databases. Itâ€™s similar to other GeoIP libraries but comes under the very liberal BSD license and also provides an extra library that optionally ships a recent version of the Geolite2 database as provided by MaxMind.

The GeoIP Legacy C library enables the user to find geographical and network information of an IP address. To use this library, you may download our free GeoLite Legacy Country or City databases. These are updated at the beginning of every month. The latest versions are available at:

  https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite

We also offer commercial GeoIP Legacy databases with greater accuracy and additional network information. For more details, see:

https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolocation_landing

If you use GeoIP Legacy to block access from high risk countries, you may wish to use our proxy detection service to block access from known proxy servers to reduce fraud and abuse. For more details, see:

# IP Geolocation Usage
IP geolocation is inherently imprecise. Locations are often near the center of the population. Any location provided by a GeoIP database should not be used to identify a particular address or household.

The python-geoip-geolite2 package includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from maxmind.com under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
